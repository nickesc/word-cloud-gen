### Overview

Build a small interactive website that visualizes topics from a news article as a 3D word cloud.

- Frontend: Use React Three Fiber (React + Three.js) to render a creative, interactive word cloud.
- Backend: Use Python + FastAPI to crawl the article, extract text, run topic modeling, and return the results to the frontend.

Goal: Demonstrate ability to integrate a custom UI with a backend pipeline that does light data mining and ML/NLP.

---

### Frontend Requirements

- Must be written in Typescript using React and React Three Fiber (Three.js for React).
- Include:
  - Input control: A simple text field for entering a URL. Pre-populate with a few sample article links for convenience.
  - API call: Send the URL to the backend and handle loading/error states.
  - 3D Visualization: Render the returned word cloud/topics in an engaging way.
- Words can vary in size, color, or position by relevance/frequency.
- Use your artistic freedom---creativity is encouraged (rotation, animation, interactivity, etc.).

---

### Backend Requirements

- Must be written in Python using FastAPI.
- Provide clear API endpoints to support the frontend. At minimum:
- POST /analyze -- accepts { "url": "<article_url>" } and returns topic/word cloud data.
- The backend should:
  - Fetch article text from the provided URL.
    - Crawling can be basic (no need to handle every edge case). Show that you can retrieve and clean meaningful text.
  - Process and analyze text:
    - Perform topic modeling or keyword extraction (e.g., TF-IDF, LDA, LSA, BERTopic).
    - Produce a list of important words/topics with weights or scores.
  - Prepare word cloud data:
    - Return structured data (e.g., JSON array with { word, weight }).

### Running The Project

- Include a minimal README describing setup, libraries used, how to run the project, and any additional notes you have
- The project must include one setup script in the root directory that:
  - Installs all dependencies for both frontend and backend
  - Starts both servers concurrently
  - No need to handle scripting cases for other operating systems aside from macOS

---

### Notes / Flexibility

- Please name your Github repo in this format: **3D-Word-Cloud-{first_name}**. For example, if your name is Alice, the name of your repo is: 3D-Word-Cloud-Alice
- Use any Python libraries you're comfortable with to complete the task.
- Emphasis is on end-to-end flow: user inputs URL → backend processes text → frontend visualizes topics.
- Focus on clarity, code organization, and creativity, not on handling every possible outcome.
- We want to see structured / consistent commit history based on features as you are developing. We should be able to look at the commit history and see the order in which you completed the project.
